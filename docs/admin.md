# Administrative Stuff

There are two areas of "Administrative" stuff that need to be considered.

## Contributors and Maintainers

I think it is best if we leave this open and allow PRs from anyone, but who will review them, approve them, etc.?

## The "Infrastructure" Side

The hosting of the application, tokens for building and pulling containers, etc. all needs to be kept private. I'd like to document it though, because that is a huge stumbling block for a lot of people getting going.
